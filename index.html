My name is Suzan, I have a Degree in Accounting and a Master Degree in Business Administration. I have more than 15 years of experience in administration and International schools.

I am responsible, reliable, can work independently. Being creative, and open-minded to face challenges increase my ability to solve problems and learn from my mistakes. Being reflective helps me to improve. As honest and faithful person, I am able to have long lasting relationships.
